- 👋 Hi, I’m Dario Aeschlimann @endu-code
- 👀 I’m interested in Robotics
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ROS for industrial applications for the Paoluzzo AG located in Ipsach, Switzerland
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on the use of Fanuc Robots and Hans Robot Elfin10 in ROS. Since I'm new to ROS I appreciate any help I can get =)
- 📫 You can reach me on my business e-mail: dario.aeschlimann@paoluzzo.ch
